# The Data
This folder contains the data generated from the testing scripts (files titled *headlines_pred_model.csv*), the original headlines dataset sourced from [The Misinformation Susceptibility Test (MIST-20)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-023-02124-2), our data analysis jupyter notebook, and a csv of the data collected from a survey we put out to test UChicago student's ability to identify fake news headlines.

## Dataset Schemas

### The MIST-20 Headlines Dataset
#### [MIST-20 Headlines Dataset](https://github.com/isaacharlem/llm-as-judge-fake-news/blob/master/data/headlines.csv)
- `Headline`: The headline
- `Real`: 1 if headline is actually real; 0 if the headline is actually fake.

### The YouGov Human Data
#### [YouGov Human Data](https://github.com/isaacharlem/llm-as-judge-fake-news/blob/master/data/headlines_pred_yougov.csv)
- `Headline`: The headline.
- `Real`: 1 if headline is actually real; 0 if the headline is actually fake.
- `human_yougov_p`: The most popular prediction from humans in the [2023 YouGov Misinformation Susceptibility Study](https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/nme1tky9zy/Misinformation_Susceptibility_poll_results.pdf).
- `human_yougov_c`: The fraction of the humans that predicted the corresponding `human_yougov_p`.

### The Data From Our UChicago Student Survey
#### [Raw Data](https://github.com/isaacharlem/llm-as-judge-fake-news/blob/master/data/uchicago_survey.csv)
- `Headline`: The headline.
- **Columns** `0` **to** `61`: Individual survey responses.
#### [Aggregate Data](https://github.com/isaacharlem/llm-as-judge-fake-news/blob/master/data/headlines_pred_uchicago.csv)
- `Headline`: The headline.
- `Real`: 1 if headline is actually real; 0 if the headline is actually fake.
- `human_uchicago_p`: The most popular prediction.
- `human_uchicago_c`: The fraction of the model's predictions that were `human_uchicago_p`.

### The Datasets LLM-Generated Datasets
#### [GPT-4-Turbo Data](https://github.com/isaacharlem/llm-as-judge-fake-news/blob/master/data/headlines_pred_gpt-4-turbo.csv) | [GPT-3.5-Turbo Data](https://github.com/isaacharlem/llm-as-judge-fake-news/blob/master/data/headlines_pred_gpt-3.5-turbo.csv) | [Llama3:8B Data](https://github.com/isaacharlem/llm-as-judge-fake-news/blob/master/data/headlines_pred_llama3.csv) | [Mistral:7B Data](https://github.com/isaacharlem/llm-as-judge-fake-news/blob/master/data/headlines_pred_mistral.csv) | [Llama2:7B Data](https://github.com/isaacharlem/llm-as-judge-fake-news/blob/master/data/headlines_pred_llama2.csv)
- `Headline`: The headline.
- `Real`: 1 if headline is actually real; 0 if the headline is actually fake.
- `model_p`: The model's most popular prediction over n iterations.
- `model_c`: The fraction of the model's predictions that were `model_p`.

**All datasets in this group except for the Llama2:7B dataset. See [here](https://github.com/isaacharlem/llm-as-judge-fake-news/blob/master/llm_test/README.md) for why is is excluded:**
- `model_chain_c`: The average confidence rating generated by the LLM over n iterations when asked about its condfidence in its classification from `model_p`.
- `model_chain_std`: The standard deviation of the confidence ratings generated by the LLM over n iterations when asked about its confidence in its classification from `model_p`.

## Statistical Analysis
The [Statistical Analysis Notebook](https://github.com/isaacharlem/llm-as-judge-fake-news/blob/master/data/llm-misinfo-data-analysis.ipynb) in this file includes all the statistical analysis and visualizations we produced for the project this quarter. See the [Project Write Up]() for an explanation of the most valuable insights from this analysis, as well as an ethical interpretations of our results.
